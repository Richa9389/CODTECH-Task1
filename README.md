Purpose
To create a user-friendly tool that allows users to perform simple calculations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) interactively.

Features
1.Input Handling:
Prompts the user to input two numbers.
Ensures user inputs are numeric and valid.

2.Operation Selection:
Allows the user to choose one of four operations:
Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (*)
Division (/)

3.Output:
Displays the result of the chosen operation.
Handles division by zero gracefully with an error message.

4.Error Handling:
Catches invalid inputs (non-numeric values).
Validates operation selection.

5.Extensibility:
Can be easily expanded to include more complex operations (e.g., square root, exponentiation).

Flow
1.Welcome message.
2.Prompt user for two numbers.
3.Display available operations and let the user choose one.
4.Perform the calculation based on the selected operation.
5.Display the result or error message if inputs/operations are invalid.

Use Case
This program is ideal for anyone needing a quick calculation tool and serves as a foundational project for learning Python's input handling, conditional logic, and error management.
